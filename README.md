Comics Connection

INTRO:
Nerd out with the greatest associative comic book data visualizer ever made. Pick your favorite character, mega-popular (Batman), or super-obscure (Flaming Carrot), and see their associations by power, enemies, allies, teams, and locations.

SCOPE:
MVP for this product will be a website that responds to users selection and reorganzies it's layout on the fly. If a user clicks on 'enemies' they will see the transition happen in real time.

Additional add on would be a comic rack that presents users with a virtual comicbook shelf and lets them see what comics were released in a given week.

Comic Connection uses the ComicVine API to mine facts about each character and present

OBJECT MODELS

Not sure if I'll be using any. The primary model will could be the character's themselves. But as all of the models are present in the database, I'm not sure that there is a need to store any, except perhaps temporarily.
